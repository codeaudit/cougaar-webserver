<body>
This package contains the <a href="http://cougaar.org">Cougaar</a>
support classes for the {@link
org.cougaar.core.service.ServletService} loaded by the {@link 
org.cougaar.lib.web.service.RootServletServiceComponent}.
<p>
The "arch" package defines generic APIs and support classes for
the {@link org.cougaar.lib.web.arch.server.ServletEngine} and
"root/leaf" servlets.  In Cougaar, the "root" is the node-level
servlet that forwards "/$" requests to local agents or redirects
the client to the appropriate remote host, and the "leaf" is
the per-agent servlet that forwards requests to that agent's
servlets.  For example, the path "/$x/y" is received by the {@link
org.cougaar.lib.web.arch.server.ServletEngine}'s "gateway" and
passed to the {@link org.cougaar.lib.web.arch.root.RootServlet},
which sees the "/$x" and forwards to local agent "x"'s {@link
org.cougaar.lib.web.arch.leaf.LeafServlet}, which forwards to that
agent's "/y" servlet.
<p>
The "arch" only depends upon "javax.servlet.*"; all the service
details and {@link org.cougaar.lib.web.arch.server.ServletEngine}
implementation are in {@link org.cougaar.lib.web.service}.
<p>

<a href="http://docs.cougaar.org">Cougaar Developers' Guide</a>.
