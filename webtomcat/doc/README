Tomcat 3.3 build as of 10/19/01.  Loaded by the
"webserver"'s "RootServletServiceComponent" via reflection.

The source contains the package:
  org.cougaar.lib.web.tomcat

The required data files are in "data/":
  conf/server.xml
  conf/modules.xml
  webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml

Depends upon "sys/tomcat_33.jar", which is a merge of 9 Tomcat 
3.3 jars that include the "org.apache.tomcat.*" packages.
