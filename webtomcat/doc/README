Implementation of "webserver"'s "ServletEngine" that uses
Tomcat 3.3 build as of 10/19/01.  Loaded by the
"webserver"'s "RootServletServiceComponent" via reflection.

The source contains the package:
  org.cougaar.lib.web.tomcat

The required data files are in "data/":
  conf/server.xml
  conf/modules.xml
  conf/tomcat-users.xml
  webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml

An example username/password login is specified in "web.xml",
with the username/password in "tomcat-users.xml".  All
requests with URL paths that end in ".secure" will be
prompted with a login page.

The code depends upon "sys/tomcat_33.jar", which is a merge 
of 9 Tomcat 3.3 jars that include the "org.apache.tomcat.*" 
packages.
