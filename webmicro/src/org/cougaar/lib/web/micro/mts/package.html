This package contains the <a href="http://cougaar.org">Cougaar</a>
message-transport-based servlet engine and tunnel.
<p>
The only way into this mts-engine is through a remote mts-tunnel.  The
local engine and remote tunnel coordinate by passing "pipe-messages" between
one another.
<p>
Together, the mts-engine and mts-tunnel can be used to tunnel remote servlet
requests to nodes that are only reachable through the message transport.  For
example:<pre>
  Node A is running the http-engine, http-redirector, and mts-tunnel
  Node B is running the mts-engine 
</pre>
This configuration may be required in embedded environments, or where node B
is not allowed to open a listening port.  A browser request to node A for an
agent on node B will be sent through the mts-tunnel, since B's mts-engine will
only register a WP entry for its mts-tunnel (it doesn't have a host:port
address).  If the configuration has both nodes running:<pre>
  http-engine, mts-engine, http-redirector, mts-tunnel
</pre>
then (by default) the http-redirector will be attempted, since it's loaded
first.  The user can override this behavior on the URL line, e.g.:<pre>
  http://host_a:1234/$(mts_tunnel)NodeB/some_path
</pre>
This manual override would be required if these nodes are only reachable via
the message transport.  A {@link 
org.cougaar.lib.web.redirect.ServletRedirectorRegistry} parameter can be
specified to set the default behavior.
<p>
For more information about URL-line options, see {@link
org.cougaar.lib.web.arch.util.PathParser}.
<p>
The "pipe" and "factory" class are generic utilities that create a stream
wrapper on top of Cougaar's package-oriented messaging support.  These
classes could be used to support other, non-servlet, stream-oriented
applications.
<p>
Instead of using the "base" ServletEngineImpl, it might be feasible to create
a Tomcat "connector" backend.
